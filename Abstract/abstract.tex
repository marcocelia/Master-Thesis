\begin{abstract}
The increasing level of complexity of modern embedded systems concurs to enhance the gap between the textual representation of High-Level System Requirements and the testing units in charge of their verification. Such gap is worsened by the possible presence of errors and omissions in the natural language requirement and causes engineers to inject into the verification units features derived from their personal interpretation.
 
The goal of this Master thesis is to provide a framework consisting of a requirement (loose) syntax, a requirements editor, a parser, and an automatic synthesis tool, which helps engineers writing high level requirements in a structured natural language with a contract-based paradigm, thus reducing, as much as possible, inconsistency and common errors, and directly generating verification monitors for a target platform.
 
To restrict the domain and the framework complexity and make the problem affordable, the first version of the tool is restricted to the controls domain and assumes the use of Simulink as a modelling and simulation tool. To ease the generation process, a control verification Simulink library has been implemented.
